frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game
===============================

##About
This is an arcade game project completed for project 3 of the Udacity frontend-nanodegree program. To see what I started with you can checkout the base code at the following url: *https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game.git*

##How To try out the code
Simply download the code from github as a zip file or use the "git clone https://github.com/mirkmasterC/project3". Once you're done, open up the unzipped folder or "cd" into the cloned repo and open up index.html in a web browser of your choice. The game should start up immediately and you are good to go!

Any problems with rendering could be due to browser compatibility issues. Try another browser and repeat. Happy gaming!
