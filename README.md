JavaScript Arcade Game
===============================

##About
This is an arcade game project completed for project 3 of the Udacity frontend-nanodegree program. To see what I started with you can checkout the base code at the following url: *https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game.git*

##How To try out the game
Visit this github.io site:
"https://mirkmasterc.github.io/"

NOTE: If the game is too large and the arrow keys are giving you trouble, try zooming out in the browser.

Or,

Simply download the code from github as a zip file or use the "git clone https://github.com/mirkmasterC/project3". Once you're done, open up the unzipped folder or "cd" into the cloned repo and open up index.html in a web browser of your choice. The game should start up immediately.

## Gameplay
Once index.html has been loaded in your browser, you move the character using the arrow keys. In order to win a game, you need to collect two or three gems, and then move the character over to the water (blue tiles). If you dont have the required score, you will be required to get another gem before hopping into the water. Refreshing the browser will restart the game.

Any problems with rendering could be due to browser compatibility issues. Try another browser and repeat. Happy gaming!
